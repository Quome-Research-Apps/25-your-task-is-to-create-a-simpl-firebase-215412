# **App Name**: NDA Now

## Core Features:

- Input Fields: Collect the necessary information via simple form inputs: Disclosing Party Name, Receiving Party Name, and Effective Date.
- Template Selection Tool: Use AI to decide which language from the template to include. For example, determine if specific clauses about intellectual property or permitted use should be present, depending on whether those topics are discussed during the call.
- Dynamic Document Generation: Generate the NDA document by inserting the provided information into a pre-defined NDA template. Handle all logic in the browser.
- Display Final NDA: Presents the fully-formed NDA on the screen in a readable format for review and allows it to be copied to the clipboard.
- Copy to Clipboard: A button or similar UI element allows the user to copy the generated NDA text directly to the clipboard for easy use.
- Client-Side Operation: All data processing and generation happen locally in the browser. No data is stored on a server to protect user confidentiality.
- Data Wipe on Close: Ensures all entered information is automatically cleared when the browser tab is closed or reloaded, providing maximum data security.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Navy blue (#3B5998) to evoke trust and professionalism.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5), very close in hue to the primary color, creating a subtle and clean backdrop.
- Accent color: Sky blue (#50A5E6), analogous to the primary, offering a touch of vibrancy without compromising the overall professional feel.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font for its modern and neutral appearance. To be used for both headlines and body text.
- Use simple, outline-style icons from a set like Feather or Material Icons to indicate actions or input fields.
- Employ a clean and straightforward layout with clear sections for input fields, document preview, and action buttons (like 'Copy to Clipboard').
- Subtle transitions or animations when the document is generated or when copying text to the clipboard.
